# Contributing

Thank you for checking out the contributing file! I'm excited to see what changes you bring to the project, and hopefully we can get this writeup to be more comprehensive as a group effort!

## Goal
The goal of this project is to serve as a r point of reference for those interested in introductory numerical analysis. As such, please explain as if you were explaining to an advanced undergraduate CS student or a new graduate student.
It's both okay and necessary to use advanced math and advanced concepts, but please explain them appropriately if they are outside of the bounds of the prerequisites in a way understandable to the target audience. 

## Standards
Mathematical notation should be utilized. Please use the LaTeX markup available to do this. Graphics are also nice, but not mandatory. Please explain any symbols that may be unfamilair to somebody at the aformentioned level, if applicable.
Please keep commits clean and somewhat formal. This is intended to be an educational document, and PR's containing profanity or insensitive materials will not be approved.
Utilization of the format provided is also expected. Changes to the structure will be considered, however, if it is deemed unnecessary, the PR will be rejected.

Please provide relevant resources as well, and if you suggest practice problems, please provide some suggested solutions.
Any case not covered by these standards will be judged on a case-by-case basis, and added in addendum to this document afterwards.

## Implementations
Implementations are welcome, and a repo to an implementation, so long as it is *your* implementation, are encouraged. Feel free to use any language that you desire, so long as it is not obfuscated and explains your method. Toy or 
practical implementations are acceptable, however, notations are mandatory.
